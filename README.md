# Baby's First TaskLoaderView

Jean-Marie Alfonsi (https://www.sharpnado.com/author/roubachof/) is a genius.

His Sharpnado tools for Xamarin.Forms (https://github.com/roubachof) are works of art. But for some (like me) the example projects may be hard to follow.

There are two reasons, I think. One is, simply, that he's a supremely skilled coder. If you aren't at his level you may not be able to understand everything happening in his code. The other reason is that there are so many great Sharpnado enhancements that, naturally, he wants to use many of them in his own example projects. This makes for great-looking examples, but if you just want to know how to use any single feature, it can be hard to pull it out and understand how it works on its own. 

This project will help, I hope, anyone struggling to understand how his TaskLoaderView (https://github.com/roubachof/Sharpnado.TaskLoaderView) works. 

I struggled for days, literally, to understand what was happening in the sample project he provides, because I'm simply not anywhere near his level. Finally, though, I was able to get this very rudimentary demonstration working. I think it might help anyone interested in using TaskLoaderView understand how to get started with it.

This very simple demonstration takes an irrelevant task (in this case fetching images from picsum.photos) and shows an orange screen while it is running, and a yellow screen when it is finished. That's it! 

There is way way way more you can do with this tool, but if you just want to understand the basics of getting a TaskLoaderView up and running, I hope this will help.
