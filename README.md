# Baby's First TaskLoaderView

Jean-Marie Alfonsi (https://www.sharpnado.com/author/roubachof/) is a genius.

His Sharpnado tools for Xamarin.Forms (https://github.com/roubachof) are works of art. But for some (like me) the example projects may be hard to follow.

This is an extremely simple demonstration of how to use his TaskLoaderView (https://github.com/roubachof/Sharpnado.TaskLoaderView). It takes an irrelevant task (in this case fetching images from picsum.photos) and shows an orange screen while it is running, and a yellow screen when it is finished. That's it! 

Honestly it took me days to figure out how to do this. That's probably because I'm just not very skilled at Xamarin.Forms. I'm posting this in hopes that it will help someone else at my level. There is way way way more you can do with this tool, but if you just want to understand the basics of getting a TaskLoaderView up and running, I hope this will help.
