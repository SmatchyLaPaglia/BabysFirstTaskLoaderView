# Baby's First TaskLoaderView

Jean-Marie Alfonsi (https://www.sharpnado.com/author/roubachof/) is a genius.

His Sharpnado tools for Xamarin.Forms (https://github.com/roubachof) are works of art. But for some (like me) the example projects may be hard to follow.

I struggled for days, literally, to understand what was happening in the TaskLoaderView sample project he provides (https://github.com/roubachof/Sharpnado.TaskLoaderView) , because I'm simply not anywhere near his level. Finally, though, I was able to get this  rudimentary demonstration working. I think it might help anyone interested in using TaskLoaderView understand how to get started with it.

This extremely simple project takes an irrelevant task (in this case fetching images from picsum.photos) and shows an orange screen while it is running, and a yellow screen when it is finished. That's it! There is way way way more you can do with this tool, but if you just want to understand the basics of getting a TaskLoaderView up and running, I hope this will help.
